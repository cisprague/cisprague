### Hi there! :v:

I'm an :us::uk:ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª AI researcher who likes to blend the reliability of model-based approaches with the adaptability of machine-learning approaches. My experience spans different aspects of critical robotic systems (planning, control, localisation, engineering) in the aerospace and maritime domains. 
I'm now leveraging parallels with robotics to improve deep generative modelling (GenAI) in the biological domain for tasks such as molecular docking and generation. 
I value out-of-the-box thinking and a first-principles approach. 

:loudspeaker:	Currently seeking a research scientist position in AI for science.

**Expertise** :monocle_face:
- Dynamics-based generative models: flow matching, diffusion models.
- Hybrid dynamical systems: switched systems, discontinuous dynamical systems, behaviour trees.

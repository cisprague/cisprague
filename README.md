### Hi there! :v:

I'm an :us::uk:ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª AI researcher who likes to blend the reliability of model-based approaches with the adaptability of machine-learning approaches. My experience spans different aspects of critical robotic systems (planning, control, localization, engineering) in the aerospace and maritime domains. 
I'm now leveraging parallels with robotics to improve inductive biases and safety in deep generative modeling (GenAI).
I value out-of-the-box thinking and a first-principles approach. 

:loudspeaker:	Currently seeking a research scientist position in structured AI (safety, planning, reasoning, decision-making, trustworthiness).

**Expertise** :monocle_face:
- **Dynamics-based generative models**: flow matching, diffusion models.
- **Hybrid dynamical systems**: switched systems, discontinuous dynamical systems, behavior trees.
